    “It is no disparagement to the many excellent publications we
    refer to, to say that in our opinion this little pocket-book of
    Hurst’s is the very best of them all, without any exception. It
    would be useless to attempt a recapitulation of the contents,
    for it appears to contain almost _everything_ that anyone
    connected with building could require, and, best of all, made
    up in a compact form for carrying in the pocket, measuring
    only 5 in. by 3 in., and about ¾ in. thick, in a limp cover.
    We congratulate the author on the success of his laborious
    and practically compiled little book, which has received
    unqualified and deserved praise from every professional person
    to whom we have shown it.”—_The Dublin Builder._

    in., yet these dimensions faithfully represent the size of the
    handy little book before us. The volume—which contains 118

2_s._; or cheaper edition, cloth, 25_s._

    This work is not, in any sense, an elementary treatise, or
    history of the steam engine, but is intended to describe
    examples of Fixed Steam Engines without entering into the
    wide domain of locomotive or marine practice. To this end
    illustrations will be given of the most recent arrangements
    of Horizontal, Vertical, Beam, Pumping, Winding, Portable,
    Semi-portable, Corliss, Allen, Compound, and other similar
    Engines, by the most eminent Firms in Great Britain and
    America. The laws relating to the action and precautions to be
    observed in the construction of the various details, such as
    Cylinders, Pistons, Piston-rods, Connecting-rods, Cross-heads,
    Motion-blocks, Eccentrics, Simple, Expansion, Balanced, and
    Equilibrium Slide-valves, and Valve-gearing will be minutely
    dealt with. In this connection will be found articles upon
    the Velocity of Reciprocating Parts and the Mode of Applying
    the Indicator, Heat and Expansion of Steam Governors, and the
    like. It is the writer’s desire to draw illustrations from
    every possible source, and give only those rules that present
    practice deems correct.
